# Unruled Minds — Open Core 🚀

> **Status:** 🚧 Pre-alpha / coming soon  
> Modular AI engine that turns mental chaos into crystal-clear execution flows  
> for ADHD-leaning creatives, founders, and misfits.

## Why this matters
We’re building a privacy-first alternative to dopamine-drip productivity apps.  
Open-sourcing the core lets anyone fork, remix, and contribute new “TRIS” flows  
(Triage → Refine → Implement → Sync) or Anchor Modes for deep focus.

## Roadmap (high level)
1. **MVP** — TRIS CLI + JSON schema output  
2. **Anchor Mode** — distraction-shield layer  
3. **Web/API** — plug-in architecture for personal dashboards  
4. Community extensions / language packs

> Follow the journey, open issues, or drop ideas.  
> First “Good first issue” drops this week — stay tuned!
